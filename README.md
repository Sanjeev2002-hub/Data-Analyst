## Problem Statement

This dashboard is a tribute to Mr. Ratan Naval Tata (28 December-9 October 2024). He served as the chairman of Tata Group and Tata Sons from 1991 to 2012 and he held the position of interim chairman from October 2016 to February 2017.

This dashboard particularly focuses on the same time period. It lets viewers to know more about him. This dashboard is a one stop solution for people who look Mr. Tata as their role model and for the people who are finance nerds and want to know more about The Tata Group itself. 

I've taken the records of various cars- commercial, Discontinued, Electric, SUV/Crossovers, Electric Concepts, Hatchbacks- that The Tata Group has manufactured in the era of Ratan Tata. I displayed it in both Table format as well as Chart format. 

This dashboard also contains The Tata Group varios subsidiary companies. It also contains a gist of Tata Group's Stocks data. 

In the last slide of the dashboard, all the awards that Mr. Rata Tata had recieved as an Individual has been tabulated giving us a gist of his marvelous work and what a personality he was. 

Tools used: SQL, Power BI, Figma.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into SQL, dataset is a csv file.

- Step 2 : In SQL, performed Data Mining, Data Analysis. 

- Step 3 : After analysing data in SQL. Shifted it to Power Query Editior from My SQL Database.

- Step 4 : First of all, Many columns didn't have their first rows as header. So I made first rows as their headers. Secondly, I trim data as to remove any extra space before the name of the subjects.

- Step 5 : Performed merger query to add columns from other table to another. Changed format of columns that supposed to have interger format and vice versa. 

- Step 6 : Work in Power Editor was finished, so now 'apply and close' the newly formed data.

- Step 7 : Went to Model view to add relationships between tables. 

- Step 8 : Set the canvas background using image I created using Figma.

- Step 10 : Created charts and various visuals to make dashboard more appealing and interactive.
